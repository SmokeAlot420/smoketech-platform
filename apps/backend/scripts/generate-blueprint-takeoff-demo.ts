- Clean residential floor plan layout with rooms clearly labeled
- Professional architectural drawing style
- Room labels only: Kitchen, Living Room, Master Bedroom, Bathroom
- Wall thickness shown with standard architectural symbols
- Door and window placements marked
- Grid lines and scale indicator visible
- Clean technical drawing aesthetic
- NO calculations, NO measurements shown on blueprint itself
- Blueprint paper is clean and uncluttered

STYLE:
- Traditional blue line blueprint style on white/light blue paper
- Professional architectural drafting quality
- Clear, legible text labels
- Technical precision and accuracy
- Realistic paper texture with slight grain
- Professional construction document appearance
- Minimal annotations on the blueprint itself

PRESERVE: Clean, readable blueprint that looks like real architectural plans with NO overlaid calculations or digital elements`;
